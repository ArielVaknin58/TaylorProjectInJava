"Stay Numb And Carry On"
02:43

[Intro]
Sselnoitome emoceb ev'I
Sselnoitome emoceb ev'I
Sselnoitome emoceb ev'I

[Chorus]
Stay numb and carry on
Too young to hate someone
Truth is, it was never love
Your fault if you thought it was
Stay numb and carry on
Too young to hate someone
Truth is, it was never love
Your fault if you thought it was

[Verse 1]
Tongue taste like liquid poison
Medicine for my inner voices
Can't drown these static noises, I tried (I tried)
Panic mode, it's Helter Skelter
Red Alert, Cherry Alka Seltzer
Shake it up and find some shelter to hide (To hide)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've become emotionless
My heart can't help but wonder where the feeling is

[Chorus]
So I just stay numb and carry on
Too young to hate someone
Truth is, it was never love
Your fault if you thought it was
Stay numb and carry on
Too young to hate someone
Truth is, it was never love
Your fault if you thought it was

[Verse 2]
I was gin and you were toxic
We have nothing good in common
Wish we'd just stayed platonic, we tried (We tried)
And my mind gets dark and ominous
Can't change it, that's just how it is
At least I'm being honest, no lie (No lie)

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't feel like anyone
The world is mad and they say I'm the crazy one

[Chorus]
So I just stay numb and carry on
Too young to hate someone
Truth is, it was never love
Your fault if you thought it was
Stay numb and carry on
Too young to hate someone
Truth is, it was never love
Your fault if you thought it was

[Bridge]
I've become emotionless (I've become emotionless)
I've become emotionless
I've become emotionless

[Chorus]
So I just stay numb and carry on
Too young to hate someone
Truth is, it was never love
Your fault if you thought it was

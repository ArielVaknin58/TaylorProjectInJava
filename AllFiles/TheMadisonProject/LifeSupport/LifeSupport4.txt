"Follow the White Rabbit"
02:59

[Verse 1]
Boy, I heard my name's on the tip of your tongue
And I'm empty too, if that is what you want
And I looked into your eyes and you're the one
That I wanted, baby, that I wanted
Baby, that I wanted

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it hauntin', baby, that I'm wantin'
Baby, that I'm wantin', wantin' you?
Hauntin', baby, that I'm wantin'
Baby, that I'm wantin'?
And I lose my mind tonight over you

[Chorus]
Devil in a dress, I'ma love you like I do
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Follow the white rabbit to see the truth
(Yeah, yeah)
I'ma need to feel that, I'ma need to feel that too
Follow the white rabbit to see the truth, truth, truth, truth
(Truth, truth, truth)

[Verse 2]
And my patience is now setting like the sun
When my tears fall on your lap, we've just begun
And by now, I know the damage has been done
That I wanted, baby, that I wanted
Baby, that I wanted

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it hauntin', baby, that I'm wantin'
Baby, that I'm wantin', wantin' you?
Hauntin', baby, that I'm wantin'
Baby, that I'm wantin'?
And I lose my mind tonight over you

[Chorus]
Devil in a dress, I'ma love you like I do
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Follow the white rabbit to see the truth
(Yeah, yeah)
I'ma need to feel that, I'ma need to feel that too
Follow the white rabbit to see the truth, truth, truth, truth
(Truth, truth, truth)

[Outro]

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

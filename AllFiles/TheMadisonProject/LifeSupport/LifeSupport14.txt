"Stained Glass"
03:27

[Verse 1]
Lately, I'm countin' the minutes that I've got left
And lately, I'm countin' the words that I haven't said
'Cause you will never know what I been through
And you should be a little more gentle
But maybe I need to start taking my own advice
'Cause my heart's so heavy, it's ready to fall out twice
'Cause you will never know what I been through
So you should be a little more gentle with me

[Chorus]
My skin is made of glass
But apparently it's stained
'Cause you notice all the cracks
But can't look inside my pain
And if you throw another stone
Then I'd stay far away, far away
I just might break

[Verse 2]
My life's just a faded memory of what I can't have
And everythin' 'round me is starting to fade into black, mmm
But black and white is so much better
I'm learning how to hide my colors
You shoulda been a little more gentle with me

[Chorus]
My skin is made of glass
But apparently it's stained
'Cause you notice all the cracks
But can't look inside my pain
And if you throw another stone
Then I'd stay far away, far away
I just might break

[Bridge]
Break
Break, mmm
Hey, might break
Might break, mmm

[Chorus]
My skin is made of glass
But apparently it's stained
'Cause you notice all the cracks
But can't look inside my pain
And if you throw another stone
Then I'd stay far away, far away
I just might break

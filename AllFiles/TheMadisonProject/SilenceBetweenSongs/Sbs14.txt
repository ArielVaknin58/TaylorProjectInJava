"King Of Everything"
04:28

[Verse 1]
Look at you go
Walkin' on everyone like steppin' stones
Buildin' a home made up of gold
Of people you hurt
Bridges to Hollywood you took, then burned
I hope it was worth it, what you get, you'll deserve it

[Pre-Chorus]
Easy come, easy go
Thought the view from the top would be different
In this stone cold bed that you made
Now you sleep alone in it

[Chorus]
Baby, you're the king of everything
Buildin' castles in the sand
That crumble in your hands (Oh, oh)
Baby, you're the king of everything (Oh-woah, oh-oh)
And, right now, you're thе man
But no one gives a damn
When thе rain comes pourin' down
To wash away your crown
You're the king of nothin' now

[Verse 2]
Look what you've done
Taken advantage of people so young
Ridin' the high road on everyone's lows

[Pre-Chorus]
Easy come, easy go
Thought the view from the top would be different
In this stone cold bed that you made
Now you sleep alone in it

[Chorus]
Baby, you're the king of everything
Buildin' castles in the sand
That crumble in your hands (Oh, oh)
Baby, you're the king of everything (Oh-woah, oh-oh)
And, right now, you're the man
But no one gives a damn
When the rain comes pourin' down
To wash away your crown
You're the king of nothin' now, now, now, now
Baby, you're the king of everything
Buildin' castles in the sand
That crumble in your hands (Oh, oh)
Baby, you're the king of everything (Oh-woah, oh-oh)
And, right now, you're the man
But no one gives a damn
When the rain comes pourin' down
To wash away your crown
You're the king of nothin'

[Outro]
When the rain comes pourin' down
To wash away your crown
You're the king of nothin' now

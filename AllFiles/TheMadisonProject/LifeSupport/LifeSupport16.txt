"Everything Happens for a Reason"
02:25

[Intro]
I still love you
I still love you

[Chorus]
I used to believe
That everything happens for a reason
But I just can't find a reason
You’d wanna hurt me so bad

[Verse]
Can't get no relief
Time moves on with the seasons
But I still can't find a reason
You’d wanna hurt me so bad

[Refrain]
And what in the world did I do
To deserve such a pain in my heart?
Guess it's true, I'm never gettin' over you
(I still love you)

[Chorus]
I used to believe
That everything happens for a reason
But I still can't find a reason
You'd wanna hurt me so bad

[Refrain]
And what in the world did I do
To deserve such a pain in my heart?
Guess it's true, I'm never gettin’ over you
(I still love you)

[Outro]
I still love you
I still love you
I still love you
I still love, love you

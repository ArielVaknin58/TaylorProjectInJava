[Verse 1]
It's like all this time
I've been waitin' for you with my open eyes
Scannin' the room for a piece of mind
You look so good in this light
It's like suddenly
All that's important's in front of me
Already know what we're gonna be
You look so good in this light

[Pre-Chorus]
I love to love, I love all the ways
I feel so much, I get carried away
I love to love
I love to love (Love, love)

[Chorus]
I love to love, I love all the ways
I feel so much, I get carried away
I love to love, I just wanna stay
I get carried away, I get carried away, I

[Post-Chorus]
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
I love to love (Love, love, love, love)
I love to love, love, love, love

[Verse 2]
I'm an open book
Typically, I feel misunderstood
No one could know me the way you could
No, I don't keep nothin' inside (I don't keep nothin' inside)
I believe in love like it's a fire, it's a feelin'
It's a touch, it's a reason
It's a light, it's a healin' (Oh)

[Chorus]
I love to love, I love all the ways
I feel so much, I get carried away
I love to love, I just wanna stay
I get carried away, I get carried away, I

[Post-Chorus]
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
I love to love (Love, love, love, love)
I love to love, love, love, love

[Bridge]
You look so good in this light
I love to love
I love to love (Love, love)

[Chorus]
I love to love, I love all the ways
I feel so much, I get carried away
I love to love, I just wanna stay
I get carried away, I get carried away, I

[Post-Chorus]
Love, love, love, love
I love, love, love (Love, love, love, love)
I love to love (Love, love, love, love)
I love to love, love, love, love

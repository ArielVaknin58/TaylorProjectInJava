"Make You Mine"
03:42

[Intro]
I-I-I
Wanna feel, feel, feel
Wanna taste, taste, taste
Wanna get you goin'
I-I-I
Wanna lay, lay, lay
Wanna string, string, string
Wanna make you mine

[Verse 1]
Step inside my mind
You can see the shrine
Got you on my walls
Believe it (Believe it)
Baby, don't be scared
Want you everywhere
Catch you if you fall
I mean it (I mean it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Closer I get
Can you resist?
It's relentless
It's why

[Chorus]
I wanna feel the rush, I wanna taste the crush
I wanna get you goin'
I wanna lay you down, I wanna string you out
I wanna make you mine
I wanna feel the rush, I wanna taste the crush
I wanna feel
I wanna lay you down, I wanna string you out
I wanna make you mine

[Post-Chorus]
I-I-I
Wanna feel, feel, feel
Wanna taste, taste, taste
Wanna get you goin'
I-I-I
Wanna lay, lay, lay
Wanna string, string, string
Wanna make you mine

[Refrain]
Make you mine
(Can't you feel the rush?)
(Can't you feel the rush?)
(Can't you feel the rush?)
Make you mine

[Verse 2]
See it in my eyes
How they never lie
Just a little bite
Are you dreamin'? (Are you dreamin'?)
Now I got you up
Would you look at us?
Fantasy to life
And I'm screamin', screamin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Closer I get
Can you resist?
It's relentless
It's why

[Chorus]
I wanna feel the rush, I wanna taste the crush
I wanna get you goin'
I wanna lay you down, I wanna string you out
I wanna make you mine
I wanna feel the rush, I wanna taste the crush
I wanna feel
I wanna lay you down, I wanna string you out
I wanna make you mine

[Post-Chorus]
I-I-I
Wanna feel, feel, feel
Wanna taste, taste, taste
Wanna get you goin'
I-I-I
Wanna lay, lay, lay
Wanna string, string, string
Wanna make you mine
I-I-I
Wanna feel, feel, feel
Wanna taste, taste, taste
Wanna get you goin'
I-I-I-I-I-I
Wanna string, string, string
Wanna make you mine

[Refrain]
Make you mine
(Can't you feel the rush?)
(Can't you feel the rush?)
(Can't you feel the rush?)
Make you mine

"Effortlessly"
02:48

[Verse 1]
Told you not to feel
Told you not to hurt at all
That just isn't real
That's a little cynical
Here's a little pill
There's a little fix-it-all
Okay, it's all okay

[Chorus]
But I'm still fading, I can't save me
Am I just gonna drown?
So I hold my breath to breathe
Hurt me so I feel
Used to do these things so effortlessly, somehow

[Verse 2]
Told you how to heal
Filled you up with chemicals
Sadness isn't real
Then why's it feel so physical?
Runnin' through your veins
Cutting right into the bone
Okay, it's all okay

[Chorus]
But I'm still fading, I can't save me
Am I just gonna drown?
So I hold my breath to breathe
Hurt me so I feel
Used to do these things so effortlessly, somehow

[Bridge]
Hold my breath to breathe
(I'm still fading)
(I'm still fading)
(I'm still fading)

[Chorus]
But I'm still fading, I can't save me
Am I just gonna drown?
So I hold my breath to breathe
Hurt me so I feel
Used to do these things so effortlessly, somehow

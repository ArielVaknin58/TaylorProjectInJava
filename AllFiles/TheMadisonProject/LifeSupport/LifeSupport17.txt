[Intro]
A human, more or less
But apparently, it's
Play like this
No, what the fâ€”
You're bad for my health, I should probably
You're bad for my health, I should probably get some help
I can't control myself, I'm addicted to the hell
I can't even sing it, I'm so excited
Oh, my God, I'm gonna cry

[Outro]
Thank you so much

"Emotional Bruises"
03:01E

[Verse 1]
How do I word this?
Was about to write you this letter
But it was just curses in cursive
You probably deserve it
But that's so impersonal, should tell you in person
I hope it don't hurt you, but then, I've been hurt too by you
The truth is, all you do is
Leave me emotional bruises

[Pre-Chorus]
You're callin' me up to link up and figure shit out
No doubt, time's out, we never figure shit out
I can't do this no more, you got me on life support

[Chorus]
'Cause this is the fifth time I've taken you back
It's the fourth time that we've relapsed
It's the third second chance that I've given you
For the first time, let this be the last
Fifth time I've taken you back
It's the fourth time that I've collapsed into your arms
It's so hard, but for the best
For the first time, let this be the last

[Verse 2]
This vicious cycle, it's driving me psycho
I'm anxious, need someone to come check my vitals (Come check my vitals)
One minute, I'm leaving, the next, I forgive you

[Pre-Chorus]
You're callin' me up to link up and figure shit out
No doubt, time's out, we never figure shit out
I can't do this no more, cutting off the life support

[Chorus]
'Cause this is the fifth time I've taken you back
It's the fourth time that we've relapsed
It's the third second chance that I've given you
For the first time, let this be the last time
Fifth time I've taken you back
It's the fourth time that I've collapsed into your arms
It's so hard, but for the best
For the first time, let this be the last

[Outro]
Please, please
Let this be the last
No, it's gotta be
It's truly the last

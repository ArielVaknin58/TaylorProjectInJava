"Home to Another One"
02:29

[Verse 1]
I know what I should say
"I don't think of you," but I do
Oh, I do, I do
Black car on the highway
Coulda sworn I saw your face
Was it you? Was it you?

[Pre-Chorus]
I still hear you

[Chorus]
Call me "baby"
I know you go home to another one
Say you hate me
It’s okay, boy, you're not the only one
Another year
We're still here
Call me "baby"
I know you go home to another one

[Verse 2]
Do you talk about me
Like I still belong to you?
Do you? Do you?
Now you hold her gently
Don’t you wish you saw us through?
'Cause I do, I do

[Pre-Chorus]
I still hear you

[Chorus]
Call me "baby"
I know you go home to another one
Say you hate me
It's okay, boy, you're not the only one
Another year
We're still hеre
Call me "baby"
I know you go home to anothеr one

[Outro]
I know you go home to another one
Another year
We're still here
Call me "baby"
I know you go home to another one

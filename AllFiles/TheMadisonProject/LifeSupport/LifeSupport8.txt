"Interlude"

[Verse]
Baby, you've been actin’ so crazy
Like I ain't still your baby
Well, you're a damn fool
It’s like your heart's in this constant eclipse
You can't decide, I don't got time for this, oh, woah
And I tried to keep my cool
And not go too crazy on you
Hear your side and curb my emotions
I won't cry you another ocean
My mind was yours to lose
No lie, that's all I would do
Would you do that shit for me too?

[Chorus]
Baby, I just wanna be someone
But I don't wanna just be someone to you
Only you, I'm not for you
Baby, I just wanna be someone
But I don’t wanna just be someone to you
Only you, I’m not for you

[Post-Chorus]
For you, yeah

"I Have Never Felt More Alive"
03:20

[Chorus]
Oh, lover
You told me I would never find another
If I went on without you, I would suffer
You said that I would struggle to survive
But I have never
Oh-oh-oh-oh, baby
Remember how you said that you would save me?
But you're the only one who needed saving
You said that I would struggle to survive
But I have never felt more alive

[Verse 1]
Remember the end?
Remember how you said that we should be friends?
Keep your friendship, I'll tell you again
I'm cuttin' my ties, I'm cuttin' my losses
Where's your mind? Have you lost it?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I made peace
But if you want war

[Chorus]
Oh, lover
You told me I would never find another
If I went on without you, I would suffer
You said that I would struggle to survive
But I have never
Oh-oh-oh-oh, baby
Remember how you said that you would save me?
But you're the only one who needed saving
You said that I would struggle to survive
But I have never felt more alive

[Verse 2]
Let me explain
I wasn't playin', no, I don't play games
You should know that you played yourself
I'm cutting you off, you've taken your last hit
There was a line and you crossed it

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I made peace
But if you want war

[Chorus]
Oh, lover
You told me I would never find another
If I went on without you, I would suffer
You said that I would struggle to survive
But I have never
Oh-oh-oh-oh, baby
Remember how you said that you would save me?
But you're the only one who needed saving
You said that I would struggle to survive
But I have never felt more alive

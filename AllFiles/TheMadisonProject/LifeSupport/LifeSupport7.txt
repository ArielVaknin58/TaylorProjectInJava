"Blue"
03:49

[Verse 1]
I was always blue behind the
Red bloodstain on my lips
You were always green with envy
Saw right through the tenderness
We were like a California sunset
Fated to die any minute
Gettin' rid of you might be the best thing I ever did

[Pre-Chorus]
And I was seein' us in a silent movie
Takin' off our gloves like a violent crime scene
Diamonds in the cut always know how to fool me
Oh, honey

[Chorus]
But I know when to run, run, run
I know when to run, run, run
I know when to run, run, run
When my makeup does, when my makeup does
And I know when to run, run, run
I know when to run, run
And I know when to run, run, run
When my makeup does, when my makeup does

[Verse 2]
I was always blue behind the
Black mascara that I cried
You could be as sweet as honey
But I knew the darkness in your mind
We were like a gorgeous bed of roses
Ready to die any minute
Gettin' rid of you might be the best thing I ever did

[Pre-Chorus]
And I was seein' us in a silent movie
Takin' off our gloves like a violent crime scene
Diamonds in the cut always know how to fool me
Oh, honey

[Chorus]
But I know when to run, run, run
I know when to run, run, run
I know when to run, run, run
When my makeup does, when my makeup does
And I know when to run, run, run
I know when to run, run
And I know when to run, run, run
When my makeup does, when my makeup does

[Bridge]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
And I know when to run, run, run
I know when to run, run, run
I know when to run, run
When my makeup does, when my makeup does

[Outro]
(Run, run, run)
(Run, run, run)
(Run, run, run)

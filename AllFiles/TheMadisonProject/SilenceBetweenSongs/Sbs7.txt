"I Wonder"
02:37

[Verse 1]
I wonder why
All of the clouds cleared from the sky
I wonder why
All of the tears dried from my eyes
I woke up happy, watched the sunrise, rise

[Pre-Chorus]
I wonder why, I wonder why
(I wonder why, I wonder why)

[Chorus]
And now each breath of air is sweeter
Birds are singin', grass is greener
Suddenly, the world is bright again (The world is bright again)
I used to live to die by
Somebody else's side, but
Now a new day breaks and I feel fine (I feel just fine)
I wonder why

[Verse 2]
I wonder how
I felt so cold, it's summеr now
I wonder how
I ever lеarned to live in doubt
It's time the walls came tumblin' down, down

[Pre-Chorus]
I wonder how, I wonder how
(I wonder how, I wonder how)

[Chorus]
And now each breath of air is sweeter
Birds are singin', grass is greener
Suddenly, the world is bright again (The world is bright again)
I used to live to die by
Somebody else's side, but
Now a new day breaks and I feel fine (I feel just fine)
I wonder why

[Outro]
(I wonder why) Each breath of air is sweeter
(I wonder why) Birds are singin', grass is greener
Why, why

"Spinnin"
02:46

[Intro]
(Ah, ah)
(Ah, ah)

[Verse 1]
Did the world stop spinnin'? Nothin' seems to change
I'm stuck at the beginnin' and I'm in pain
Did the sun stop risin'? 'Cause the sky's so gray
Did the world stop spinnin' today?

[Chorus]
I woke up, fell back to sleep
'Cause I'd rather live in my dreams
I lay here wondering why

[Verse 2]
Did the world stop spinnin'? Am I frozen in time?
'Cause the birds stopped singin', are we flawed by design?
My heartbeat's racin' like a strange ballet
Did the world stop spinnin' today?

[Chorus]
I woke up, fell back to sleep (Sleep)
'Cause I'd rather live in my dreams (Ah)
I lay here wondering why
Did the world stop spinning or did I?

[Bridge]
The world has stopped spinning
The lights are all dimming and, ah
The world has stopped spinning
The end is beginning and, ah
(Ah, ah)
(Ah, ah)

[Outro]
Oh, the world stopped spinnin', nothin' seems to change
I'm stuck at the beginnin' and I'm still in pain
Why'd the sun stop shinin'? Why's the sky still gray?
Oh, the world stopped spinnin' today

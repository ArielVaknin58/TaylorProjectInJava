[Intro]
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

[Verse 1]
I always knew that you existed, no one listened
How come when you drove by, you wouldn't stop to visit?
My mom and dad said they first met under the moonlight
I didn't buy their cover story, it didn't feel right
'Cause I belong in space, floatin' with debris
Somethin' 'bout this place never did feel right to me

[Chorus]
Countin' the stars, they all felt so far
But it's always felt like home to me
What took you so long?
They thought that I was wrong
But now, they'll all see
They're all gonna see
That's where I'm meant to be
Now, they're all gonna see
It's where I'm meant to be

[Verse 2]
And you're so lucky, lookin' down on everybody
Me, alone and fakin' at this afterparty
These ain't my people, ain't my crew, it ain't my planet
These humans speak my language, still don't understand it
I wish you took me with you when you left that day
And everything looks perfect when you're far away

[Chorus]
Countin' the stars, they all felt so far
But it's always felt like home to me
What took you so long?
They thought that I was wrong
But now, they'll all see
They're all gonna see
That's where I'm meant to be
Now, they're all gonna see
It's where I'm meant to be

[Chorus]
Countin' the stars, they all felt so far
But it's always felt like home to me
What took you so long?
They thought that I was wrong
But now, they'll all see
They're all gonna see
That's where I'm meant to be
Now, they're all gonna see
It's where I'm meant to be

[Outro]
I put a spatially tessellated void inside a modified temporal field
Until a planet developed intelligent life
I then introduced that life to the wonders of electricity
Which they now generate on a global scale
And you know, some of it goes to power my engine and charge my phone and stuff
Rick, take us home, now
Alright, alright, fine, Morty

"Sour Times"
02:45E

[Verse 1]
We're rum and holy water
We're so bad for each other
Too quick to lose your patience
Short tempered and abrasive
There's just no way to save this

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't wanna lead you on
I just wanna make it clear
I don't know what song of mine you heard that made you think
I'd want to spend the night with you
Boy, take it easy
Won't spend the night with you, boy

[Chorus]
In these sour times, oh yeah
Sour times
In these sour times, oh yeah
Sour times

[Verse 2]
If I'm being candid (Yeah, yeah)
I'm rippin' off the bandage (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I don't want you thinkin'
My heart's in the equation
It's crazy that you'd be down to be a fucking rebound, no
Ain't even in my right mind, and you think that's a green light
And that just doesn't seem right, no

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna lead you on
I just wanna make it clear
I don't know what song of mine you heard that made you think
I'd want to spend the night with you
Boy, take it easy
Won't spend the night with you, boy

[Chorus]
In these sour times, oh yeah (In these sour times)
Sour times
In these sour times, oh yeah (In these sour times)
Sour times

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah

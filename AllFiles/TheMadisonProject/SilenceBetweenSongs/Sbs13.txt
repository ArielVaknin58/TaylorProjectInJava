"Silence Between Songs"
02:29

[Verse 1]
You wanna know the demons in my head
But you don't know they're sleepin' in your bed
I pop a pill to try and numb the pain
When it's just me and my brain
I medicate, that's what you made me do
My broken heart, it dreams in baby blue
The music fades and then I think of you

[Chorus]
Oh, I never knew
That the silence between songs (Songs)
Could ever be so lonely and so long
'Til I lost you

[Verse 2]
It's killin' me, I know it's killin' you
The violins are playin' out of tune
I never sleep, just naked in my room

[Chorus]
Oh, I never knew
That the silеnce between songs (Songs)
Could evеr be so lonely and so long
'Til I lost you

[Bridge]
I can't be alone
With my thoughts
When the music's off
No, I can't turn them down
Tune them out
Don't know how

[Chorus]
Oh, I never knew
That the silence between songs (Songs)
Could ever be so lonely and so long

[Outro]
So listen close to the silence after this song

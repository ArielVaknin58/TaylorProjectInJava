[Verse 1]
Grew up in the same house
So I know why you lash out
Oh, I understand you
More than you think I do
Cracks in the windows
Castles and pillows
And all of the places
I built us to hide

[Verse 2]
I always left you out
You still loved me somehow
You just wanted a friend
Didn't know it then
But now I do
Our youth down the drain
And I'll take all of the blame
For all of the countless
Times that you cried

[Chorus]
Just two kids caught in the crossfire
Close your eyes, I know you're so tired
Just kids, you and I, I know it's hard sometimes
But you'll be alright, we'll be alright

[Verse 3]
All that's unspoken
All the years that werе stolen
You were still in that housе
I shouldn't have left you behind
And I fall to pieces
Sometimes all that you need is
A shoulder to cry
And I'm lucky that you're mine

[Chorus]
Just two kids caught in the crossfire
Close your eyes, I know you're so tired
Just kids, you and I, I know it's hard sometimes
But you'll be alright, we'll be alright

[Bridge]
Aah
Aah
We'll never change as time fades
Aah

[Chorus]
Just two kids caught in the crossfire
Just close your eyes, I know you're so tired
Just kids, you and I, I know it's hard sometimes
But you'll be alright, we'll be alright

"Default"

[Verse]
Breathin' gets so hard for me now
It's speedin' up and slowin' back down
When did breathin' get so hard under the moonlight?
If you're hearing this, I hope that you're proud
Can't even count how many times I let you down
If there's a God or there's a sign, it's time that you send it out

[Chorus]
And, oh, my love, you bring me back to default
The more I spill it out
You bring me down to such a deep hole, honey (Oh)

[Outro]
I know how long this must be
Comin' for me
I swear, I swear I will be
The end of me, the end of me
You take, you takе
Every last drop from me
I feel this will be
Thе death of me, the death of me

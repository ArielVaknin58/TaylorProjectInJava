"HeartLess"
02:38

[Verse 1]
Voicemail is full
Glass is half empty
I want you bad, I want it that bad
I get what I want
But maybe I shouldn't
'Cause that would be bad, that would be so bad

[Pre-Chorus]
One, two, three, four, five, too many times
I've been down this road too many nights
So next time

[Chorus]
I should use my heart, I should use my heart
I should use my heart less
Use my heart, I should use my heart
I should use my heart less, No

[Verse 2]
Should kiss you goodbye
Maybe I shouldn't
Not when it's good, not when it's this good
And I never learn
So maybe it's my fault
I always love, I love you too hard

[Pre-Chorus]
One, two, three, four, five, too many times
I've been down this road too many nights
So next time

[Chorus]
I should use my heart, I should use my heart
I should use my heart less
Use my heart, I should use my heart
I should use my heart less, No
I should use my heart less

[Bridge]
Voicemail is full
Glass is half empty
I want you bad, I want it that bad

[Chorus]
I should use my heart, I should use my heart
I should use my heart less
Use my heart, I should use my heart
I should use my heart less, No
I should use my heart less

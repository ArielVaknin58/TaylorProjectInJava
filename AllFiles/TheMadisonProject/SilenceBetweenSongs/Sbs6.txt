"Nothing Matters But You"
02:45

[Verse 1]
I don't know how I survived before I met you
Watchin' you through glassy eyes, sinkin' into blue

[Pre-Chorus]
If you never stop me (Stop me)
Then I'll just keep fallin'

[Chorus]
Nothin' matters but you (Ooh)
Nothin' matters but you (Ooh)
Nothin' matters but you
Make a girl think the world's only spinnin' for you (Ooh)
Nothin' matters but

[Verse 2]
You belong to me tonight
Hold me while I cry (Hold me while I cry)
Swimmin' underneath moonlight
Taken by the tide (Taken by the tide)

[Pre-Chorus]
If you never stop me (Stop me)
Then I'll just keep fallin'

[Chorus]
Nothin' matters but you (Ooh)
Nothin' matters but you (Ooh)
Nothin' matters but you
Make a girl think the world's only spinnin' for you (Ooh)
Nothin' matt–µrs but you (Ooh)
Nothin' matters but you

"At Your Worst"
02:58

[Intro]
Ah, ah, mmm

[Verse 1]
I taught myself to cry on cue
I close my eyes and think of you
It's not that hard for me to do
'Cause everythin' leads back to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I know you got your reasons
You got your demons

[Chorus]
But I hope I never hate myself
The way I know you hate yourself
It hurts to see you hurt
The ones who love you at your worst
I'm sorry you don't trust yourself
Enough to trust somebody else
It hurts to see you hurt
The only ones who love you at your worst

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I know it's sad (I know it's sad)
I miss you too (I miss you too)
You're turnin' red (You're turnin' red)
Oh, this isn't like you
But it's no excuse for all the times
You broke my heart and made mе cry

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I know you got your reasons (I know)
You got your demons (Your demons)

[Chorus]
But I hopе I never hate myself
The way I know you hate yourself
It hurts to see you hurt
The ones who love you at your worst
I'm sorry you don't trust yourself
Enough to trust somebody else
It hurts to see you hurt
The only ones who love you at your worst

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
But sometimes I still hate myself
The way you made me hate myself
It hurts to know I hurt
The ones who love me at my worst
I'm sorry I don't trust myself
Enough to trust somebody else
It hurts to know I hurt
The only ones who love me at my worst

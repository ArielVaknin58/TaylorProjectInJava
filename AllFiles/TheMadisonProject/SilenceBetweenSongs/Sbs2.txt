"Sweet Relief"
02:41

[Verse 1]
Please, leave, Godspeed
I can't be around you right now, don't speak
It's a problem, it's addictive, I need
You to listen to me, baby, listen to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Take me high (Take me high)
Lay me down (Lay me down)
It's so reckless of me, but this feeling is deeply profound

[Chorus]
It's just something only we know
Baby, I can't help myself
I'm seein' you everywhere I go
I don't dream of anyone else
All I need, sweet relief
It's just somethin' only we know
Something only we know

[Verse 2]
Can't eat, can't sleep
No, you're not makin' this easy on me
It's a problem that we're choosin' to be
No, we won't let 'em see (No, we won't let 'em see)

[Pre-Chorus]
Take me high (High)
Lay me down (Lay me down)
It's so reckless of me, but this feeling is deeply profound

[Chorus]
It's just something only we know (We know)
Baby, I can't help myself
I'm seein' you everywhere I go
I don't dream of anyone else
All I need, sweet relief
It's just somethin' only we know
Something only we know

[Bridge]
Ooh
Something only we know
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Something only we know

[Outro]
All I need, sweet relief
It's just somethin' only we know
Something only we know

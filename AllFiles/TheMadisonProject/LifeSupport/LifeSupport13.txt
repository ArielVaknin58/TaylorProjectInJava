"Baby"
03:27

[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, tell me, what's the antidote?
Wouldn't  text you this late 'less there's somethin' wrong
I  look too good to be in this bedroom
Without someone to touch me like you do

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe there is something I can take for this
How  much longer I gotta wait for this?
I  can see my body on your lips
On your lips, yeah
You  know once you get a taste for it
You will need it, you would pay for it
Go and empty out the bank for this (Oh)

[Chorus]
If you wanna be my baby
Know  I'm gonna drive you mad
Probably gonna call me crazy
I'm the best you ever had, yeah
I can turn you on, on, on
Why your clothes still on, on, on?
If you wanna be my baby
Know I'm gonna drive you mad
Probably gonna call me crazy
I'm the best you ever had, yeah
I can turn you on, on, on
Why your clothes still on, on?
Keep you comin' back for more

[Verse 2]
Baby, baby, do I taste like candy?
Sugarcoated, he say I'm the most sweet
I'm a handful, but that's what hands are for
Pin me to the floor, treat it like it's yours

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe there is something I can take for this
How much longer I gotta wait for this?
I can see my body on your lips
On your lips, yeah
You know once you get a taste for it
You will need it, you would pay for it
Go and empty out the bank for this

[Chorus]
If you wanna be my baby
Know I'm gonna drive you mad
Probably gonna call me crazy
I'm the best you ever had, yeah
I can turn you on, on, on
Why your clothes still on, on, on?
If you wanna be my baby
Know I'm gonna drive you mad
Probably gonna call me crazy
I'm the best you ever had, yeah
I can turn you on, on, on
Why your clothes still on, on?
Keep you comin' back for more

[Bridge]
Alone and I'm feelin' myself, but, ooh, baby
It's better when I have some help from my baby
I got that love you can't handle, but maybe
You can try
I look too good to be up in this bedroom
Need someone like you to touch me like you do
Whisper my name in my ear, that's like music
You know just what I wanna hear, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
If you wanna be my baby
Know I'm gonna drive you mad
Probably gonna call me crazy
I'm the best you ever had, yeah
I can turn you on, on, on
Why your clothes still on, on, on?
If you wanna be my baby
Know I'm gonna drive you mad
Probably gonna call me crazy
I'm the best you ever had, yeah
I can turn you on, on, on
Why your clothes still on, on?
Keep you comin' back for more

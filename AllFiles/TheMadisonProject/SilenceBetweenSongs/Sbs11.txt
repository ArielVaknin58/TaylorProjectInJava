"Dangerous"
03:47

[Intro]
(Ah)

[Verse 1]
I'll remember you this way
Keep you safe inside my memory
But I’ve held you here for far too long
I wonder if you think of me
I'm still putting up a fight
While you're off and you’re forgetting me
Never got the chance to tell our story
A tale as old as time

[Pre-Chorus]
Where did you go?
Is it something I said? (Something I said)
Why am I alone in this bed?

[Chorus]
Tell me the truth
What did I do?
Look at me
Why can't I see?
No, it can't be this easy
To let me go
But if you say so
Guess I make love too dangerous

[Post-Chorus]
Mm-mm

[Verse 2]
Right when I think I hate you
Something pulls me under like the tide
Even picked a house and chose our kids' names
You'd always be mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Where did you go?
Is it something I said? (Something I said)
Why am I alone in this bed?

[Chorus]
Tell me the truth
What did I do?
Look at me
Why can't I see?
No, it can't be this easy
To let me go
But if you say so
Guess I make love too dangerous

[Bridge]
Ooh
I do

[Chorus]
Tell me the truth
What did I do?
Look at me
Why can't I see?
No, it can’t be this easy
To let me go

[Outro]
Ooh

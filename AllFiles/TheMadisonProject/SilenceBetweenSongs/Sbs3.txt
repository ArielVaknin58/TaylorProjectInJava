"Envy the Leaves"
03:19

[Verse 1]
I envy the leaves
That grow from the trees
They're all so carefree
Through the seasons, unaware of the fall
If only I'd see (See)
It's quite easy to be (Be)
A drop in the ocean with no worries and no questions at all

[Chorus]
Why don't we lie and
Act like the best is yet to come?
Why don't we try that
Just for once?

[Verse 2]
I envy the snow (Snow)
How it's blissfully cold (Cold)
The world around, it is meltin' and it still doesn't know
It could be so sweet (Sweet, sweet)
If only I were naive (Naive)
Enough to believe that I am happy, but, still, I'm not sold

[Chorus]
Why don't wе lie and
Act like the bеst is yet to come?
Why don't we try that
Just for once?

[Bridge]
For once
For once
Why don't we try that
Just for once?
Ooh
Ooh
Just for once?

[Outro]
I envy the leaves
That grow from the trees
They're all so carefree
Through the seasons, unaware of the fall
